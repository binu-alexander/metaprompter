# Prompt Transformer

You've written the same type of prompt dozens of times. "Write a professional email..." "Create a summary..." "Generate code for..." Each time starting from scratch, hoping you remember all the important details.

What if you could capture the perfect prompt structure once and remember and reuse it at will ?

_Prompt Transformer_ takes your messy, one-off prompts and extracts the underlying template. Feed it "Write a professional email declining a meeting" and get back a structured JSON with role, audience, tone, constraints, and format specs.

Now you have a reusable template. Your team can use it. Your API can consume it. You can review it, version it, test variations, and build entire prompt libraries.

One transformation. Infinite reuse. And if you want to go one step further modify the transformer itself for your own needs
